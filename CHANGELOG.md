# 0.9.x

## (Unreleased)

* Separated the network code from the ruby-dicom gem to create a dedicated
  'dicomnet' gem, leaving the old gem dedicated to handling DICOM files.


# Previous history

Note that the dicomnet library was spun off from the network code of the
original [ruby-dicom](https://github.com/dicom/ruby-dicom) gem. For the
pre-dicomnet part of this code's history, please refer to the
[changelog](https://github.com/dicom/ruby-dicom/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rdoc)
of the dicom gem (versions 0.6 - 0.9.5).
